# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

## Project Overview
DataSpark is a comprehensive data analysis project designed to uncover valuable insights for Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics. The aim is to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By analyzing customer, product, sales, store, and currency exchange data, we deliver actionable recommendations to improve marketing strategies, inventory management, sales forecasting, and international pricing.

## Skills Takeaway
1) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3) Python
4) SQL (Data Management)
5) Power BI

## Domain
Retail Analytics in the Electronics Industry

## Problem Statement
As part of Global Electronics' analytics team, the task is to analyze multiple datasets containing customer, product, sales, store, and exchange rate information. The objective is to identify patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help improve customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

## Business Use Cases
1) Customer Insights: Understand customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and segmentation.
2) Sales Optimization: Improve sales performance by analyzing product popularity, profitability, and store performance.
3) Inventory Management: Use sales data to optimize inventory planning and store expansions.
4) Pricing Strategy: Analyze the impact of currency exchange rates on international sales.

## Approach
### Data Cleaning & Preparation:
1] Handle missing values.
2] Convert data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
3] Merge datasets (e.g., link sales data with product and customer data).

### Load Data:
Insert preprocessed data into SQL tables using SQL INSERT statements.

### Power BI Visualization:
Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau and create interactive dashboards.

### Develop SQL Queries:
Formulate 10 SQL queries to extract key insights, such as sales trends, product performance, and store analysis.

## Analysis Steps
## 1. Customer Analysis
Demographic Distribution: Analyze customer gender, age, location (city, state, country, continent).
Purchase Patterns: Study average order value, frequency, and product preferences.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on demographics and behavior.

## 2. Sales Analysis
Overall Sales Performance: Analyze total sales over time, trends, and seasonality.
Sales by Product: Evaluate top-performing products by quantity and revenue.
Sales by Store: Assess store performance.
Sales by Currency: Understand the impact of currency exchange on sales.

## 3. Product Analysis
Product Popularity: Identify the most and least popular products.
Profitability Analysis: Calculate profit margins (Unit Cost vs. Unit Price).
Category Analysis: Analyze performance by product categories and subcategories.

## 4. Store Analysis
Store Performance: Evaluate sales performance based on store size and operational data.
Geographical Analysis: Identify top-performing store locations.

## Results
At the end of the project, a detailed EDA report will be delivered, featuring:
1] Clean and integrated datasets
2] Insights into customer behavior, product performance, store operations, and currency impact
3] Visualizations: Compelling and clear visuals built using Power BI/Tableau
4] Actionable Recommendations: Tailored strategies for enhancing marketing, optimizing inventory, and improving sales forecasting.

## Dataset Explanation
The project utilizes datasets provided by Global Electronics, including information on:
1] Customers
2] Products
3] Sales
4] Stores
5] Currency Exchange Rates

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models to predict future sales trends.
- Introduce more advanced customer segmentation techniques using clustering algorithms.
- Incorporate real-time currency exchange rate updates for more accurate sales forecasting.
- Expand the analysis to include more detailed regional insights.
